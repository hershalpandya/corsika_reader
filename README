###  README --- CORSIKA reader
#
## Author: Javier Gonzalez

C++/Python utility for reading CORSIKA files. This is based on the Auger corsika reader.

----------------
| Requirements:
----------------

 1.- CMake.
 2.- Boost development libraries (libboost-...-dev): python, iostreams, test
 3. Needs newer gcc version. If you are using it on cobalt, here is an excerpt from cobalt testbed page:

"CERN Developer Toolset version 2 is available the Cobalt Testbed. It includes newer versions of some developer tool than what is provided by Scientific Linux. In particular, gcc 4.8.x is included. More information here: http://linux.web.cern.ch/linux/devtoolset.
Run scl enable devtoolset-2 bash to start a new shell with devtoolset-2 enabled. Note that you need to run that command for each shell you want to use devtoolset in"

----------------
| installation:
----------------

  cmake /path/to/source -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install -DFETCH_CORSIKA_DATA=True
  make
  make install

One can use options like these to make sure Boost and python are found:
 -DBOOST_ROOT=/opt/boost/1_55_0
 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/Users/javierg/Python/Environments/maverick/include/python2.7
 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.6/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
or
 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/cvmfs/icecube.opensciencegrid.org/standard/RHEL_6_x86_64/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/cvmfs/icecube.opensciencegrid.org/standard/RHEL_6_x86_64/lib/libpython2.7.so
 -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR=$I3_PORTS/include/boost-1.38.0 -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=$I3_PORTS/lib/boost-1.38.0

| Examples:
------------

There are a few python examples that get installed in share/corsika/examples/python. For some plotting examples you need PyRoot, but these will be removed. For others you need matplotlib.
